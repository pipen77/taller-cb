Mead",19th century,"A lively tradition of provincial Mexican religious art has existed from the Spanish colonial period through the present day. The subject of this devotional image, rendered in the popular medium of painted tin, also appeared in more formal colonial Mexican altar paintings. Perched on the tips of the fingers of a detached hand, Christ appears flanked by his parents and his grandparents, Anna and Joachim. The symbol of the hand, deriving from the European cult of Saint Anne, also bears the wound of the stigmata in reference both to the Crucifixion and to the life of Saint Francis; the seven lambs, drinking here from the chalice of Christ's blood, derive from the Book of Revelations.<br /><p>Object metadata can change over time, please check the Brooklyn Museum <a href=""http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/766/Mano_Poderosa_The_All-Powerful_Hand_or_Las_Cinco_Personas_The_Five_Persons"" rel=""nofollow"">object record</a> for the latest information.</p>",13 7/8 x 10 1/16 in.

For this series—produced for his most faithful patron Thomas Butts, a government clerk—Blake drew on chapters 12 and 13 of the Book of Revelations, an apocalyptic text akin to the artist's own prophetic writings.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this narrative the Dragon, identified with Satan, schemes to seize the soon-to-be born Redeemer from his mother. Derived from the Virgin Mary of the Gospels, the figure known as the Woman Clothed with the Sun also stands for Israel and for the Church. Blake's threatening Dragon displays powerful musculature as well as its monstrous tail, wings, and horned heads. Subsequent scenes reveal the failure of the Dragon's plan but the emergence of new threats to mankind.<br /><p>Object metadata can change over time, please check the Brooklyn Museum <a href=""http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/4368/The_Great_Red_Dragon_and_the_Woman_Clothed_with_the_Sun_Rev._12%3A_1-4"" rel=""nofollow"">object record</a> for the latest information.</p>",Image: 17 3/16 x 13 11/16 in.

This triptych, intended for private devotion, is the only complete work of this size that can be attributed with certainty to his hand. Even at this scale, the figures have a Giottesque magnitude and solidity. Maso surrounds the central Madonna, enlarged and enthroned to emphasize her majesty, with a choir of twenty saints, whose number is implied by the neatly overlapping, tooled halos. This approach to representing depth, before the invention of perspective, reveals a simultaneous sophistication and naïveté. In a series of separate scenes, stacked one above the other on the wings of the triptych, the pictorial program recounts episodes of the Life of Christ, from the Annunciation to the Crucifixion.<br /><p>Object metadata can change over time, please check the Brooklyn Museum <a href=""http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/4711/Madonna_with_Saints_and_Scenes_of_the_Life_of_Christ_portable_altarpiece"" rel=""nofollow"">object record</a> for the latest information.</p>",Center panel: 30 1/8 x 11 3/4 in.

It describes the legendary lives of the kings of Iran from creation to the Arab conquest of the country between the 630s and the 650s. Over the centuries that followed its composition, the tales of the <i>Shahnama </i>had become widely popular; by the early fourteenth century, <i>Shahnama </i>manuscripts had become one of the principal vehicles for Persian painting. This illustrated page belongs to one of the earliest surviving illustrated <i>Shahnamas</i>.

After much hesitation, Baraham allows the disguised king to spend the night in his courtyard, on the condition that he pay for any damage he may inflict and that he clean up after his horse. Bahram and his horse spend the night outdoors while his host enjoys a sumptuous feast inside.
